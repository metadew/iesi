# Configure your script - Introduction
## Before you start
The automation framework focuses on configuring scripts once and executing them many times. To achieve this in the most effective and efficient manner, automation engineers can make use of a variety of reusable constructs for which we often refer to as ‘building blocks’ during the design phase. It is possible to automate a single use case in many ways. It is the engineer’s level of skill, creativity and design expertise that will result extremely powerful and effective automation solutions.

## The script building
Central to any automation is the script. In a script, it is possible to **define a set of actions** that needs to be executed **in a specific sequence**. **An action** is the **lowest level of execution that exists**. It takes a set of input parameters, and performs a single (set of) operation(s) generating a technical outcome.

**Depending on the type of operation**, the framework has embedded the notion of **action types**. During the design of the script, the automation engineer can make use of these types to quickly create a script. The framework will help limiting the effort by focusing on required parameters only.

Examples of actions:
*	Execute a file transfer
*	Execute a command from commandline
*	Execute a sql query on a database
*	Execute a http request
*	…

In this section, we will highlight the most important aspects of script design. You can find more detailed information about each aspect in our subpages:
