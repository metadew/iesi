## What we would like to achieve

**IESI** helps you leveraging your enterprise by bringing **automation for everyone**, making automation **accessible** and **affordable** for any project or purpose.

With IESI, we would like to bring automation to everyone in convenient and affordable way. Automation may not be a boundary or limitation. Whether you are working in a large or small organization, automate end-to-end processes across an entire organization or like to experiment at home or in the cloud, with the IESI framework you should be able to leverage our framework to be up and running in no time. Why still do it manually, if you can use our framework to apply automation in less than 1 hour?

> Automation needs to be easy, driven by configuration and augmented with metadata

## Our framework introduced
**Intelligent, Enhanced & Seamless Industrialization** or **IESI** is an automation framework originally created at Accenture with focus to automate end-to-end delivery and testing processes for data driven initiatives (integration or migration). **It allows the configuration, execution and reporting on automated executions, therefore driving development, testing and deployment.**

With every data-driven framework, concepts such as efficiency, reusability and flexibility are key for delivering a high-end automation framework.  We would like to further differentiate ourselves by also making it accessible and affordable for any project or organization. 

### Key Features
- **Fast Install** <br>
    Zero-touch on-premise (Future: Cloud Containers) - Be up and running in less than 1 hour.

- **Broad Access** <br>
    Get [ROI](/{{site.repository}}/pages/benefits/businesscase.html) for small and large projects or organizations - Instant ROI and savings with our tool that you can               trial before buying.
      
- **Easy to use** <br>
    Fast automation through reusable configuration and modularity – Increase test coverage and execute more in less time.
      
- **Agnostic** <br>
    Technology, vendor, industry independent – Easy plug-in and blend-in.

> Test automation (and data-driven automation in general) should not be considered a commodity but will provide many ways of differentiation in the future

### Key Benefits
- **Enable digital transformations and end-to-end automation across technologies** <br>
    With IESI, we bring a powerful and intelligent engine that connects to any type of technology, orchestrates actions and caches information, being able to run on top of           both legacy and new systems.
      
- **Accelerate time-to-market** <br>
    Increase your delivery time through the flexible, reusable approach of our configuration and design. Being able to create and run agonistic of the target environment             (from development to production), configuration and script design are highly maintainable and easy for non-programmers to use.

- **Monitor the user experience proactively**<br>
    Apply pro-active alerting and detect irregularities faster through the end-to-end (functional) monitoring capabilities. Provide the team with faster feedback and                 reduced debugging time.
      
- **Complement and augment existing automation tools**<br>
    Integrate into your DevOps pipeline and complement your test automation tools with the IESI framework. We complement rather than replace what you currently have and             create on-demand plugins for specific technologies or logic. 

> Grows best when we combine innovation with real life experiences and common sense, together with the community.
