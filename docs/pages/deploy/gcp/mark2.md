# Mark1 deployment on GCP

This configuration will perform a Mark2 deployment using Terraform.

You can find all relevant assets at the following location: ```deploy/gcp/mark2```

## General prerequisites
* Make sure that Terraform is up-and-running, if not have a look [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/gcp/intro)
* Select a project to deploy to. If none exists, create a new project.
* Enable the Google Compute Engine API
* Enable the Cloud Resource Manager API
* Create a service account for Terraform to do the necessary work for you.
* Ensure the service account is assigned with the ```roles/servicenetworking.networksAdmin``` role

You can find more information on the above three steps [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/gcp/build).

## Template prerequisites
* The iesi-instance will be created with the option `os login` enabled. Click [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/oslogin) to learn more.

## Getting started
* Complete the parameters in the `setenv.sh` file and source it
* Complete parameters in the `terraform.tfvars` file that can be persisted on disk
* Run the following commands with the ```tf-launch.sh``` script

```
./tf-launch.sh init
./tf-launch.sh apply
./tf-launch.sh destroy
./tf-launch.sh cleanup
```

And you are ready to go! Check it out in the console!

## Components

* google_compute_network -> custom VPC network
* google_compute_subnetwork -> custom VPC subnetwork
* google_compute_global_address
* google_service_networking_connection -> private VPC peering for Cloud SQL
* google_compute_address
* google_compute_instance -> empty instance
  * google_compute_address -> static IP address
  * google_compute_firewall -> SSH access
* google_sql_database_instance -> only using private ip
  * google_sql_database
  * google_sql_user -> admin user

## Important attention points
* Mark2 makes use of private VPC peering in a custom VPC network. While Terraform successfully creates and updates resources, it has issues correctly destroying all resources. You will need to manually delete internal VPC peering and the network itself from the console or using the appropriate gcloud commands.
