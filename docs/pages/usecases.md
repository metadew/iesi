# Use Cases

IESI can be used for multiple purposes within your project. The ETL Flow use case was one example we already touched upon, many more have been realized, demonstrating the value of the framework, enabling automation across solutions.

Our realized use cases supported in the:
* **Enabling of digital transformations** - maintain quality across digital and legacy solutions
* **Accelerating software delivery time-to-market**
* **Complementation with existing automation tooling** - adding integration across automation tools
