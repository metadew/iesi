# About

Intelligent ETL Solution Industrialization or *IESI* is an automation framework created at Accenture to automate end-to-end delivery and 
testing processes for data driven initiatives (integration or migration). It allows the configuration, execution and 
reporting on automated executions driving development, testing and deployment automation. 

IESI was designed primarily with configuration and reuse in mind. 
It has been used at several projects and clients over the past years and evolves along with these initiatives. 
Please consider that the open source release is underway and efforts are undertaken to improve features and documentation. 
In the meantime, feel free to download and experiment with the automation framework and get acquainted with our approach. 
[We welcome contributors](/{{site.repository}}/pages/contribute/contribute.html) from any organization or background to help us grow the framework.

Feel free to get in touch via our [Github](https://github.com/metadew/iesi) or our [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/metadew) page.
