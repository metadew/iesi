# About

Intelligent, Enhanced & Seamless  Industrialization or *IESI* is an automation framework created at Accenture to automate end-to-end delivery and 
testing processes for data driven initiatives (integration or migration). It allows the configuration, execution and 
reporting on automated executions driving development, testing and deployment automation. 

While previously named *Intelligence ETL Solution Industrialization*, the framework has been renamed to avoid the association of the term *ETL* with causes confusion about the framework's use as if it is only applicable for data warehousing type applications. 
Instead, the term *ETL* needs to be read in its conceptual essence: extract, transform, load or rather input, process, output. So, this applies to all types of systems and processes, from backend to data platforms and connectivity.

IESI is designed primarily with configuration and reuse in mind. 
It has been used at several projects and clients over the past years and evolves along with these initiatives. 
Please consider that the open source release is underway and efforts are undertaken to improve features and documentation. 
In the meantime, feel free to download and experiment with the automation framework and get acquainted with our approach. 
[We welcome contributors](/{{site.repository}}/pages/contribute/contribute.html) from any organization or background to help us grow the framework.
