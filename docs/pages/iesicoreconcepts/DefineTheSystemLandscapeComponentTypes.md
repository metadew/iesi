## Component Types
Components are created in order to provide the automation engineers with **high reusability and parameterization**. The component type is used as a switch for the connectivity options and is stored in a component-library.

A component is defined with its technical details (e.g. name/path) and the type (e.g. http/other), and is given a logical name in order to be called upon during script execution.

Depending on the goal of your automation use cases, **we are able to custom develop specific component types** (e.g. usage of mainframe operations).
